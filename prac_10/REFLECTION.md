# Reflection on Practical Tasks Estimates

During the practical tasks, my accuracy in estimating the time required for completion varied. In the early stages, I found it challenging to accurately predict the time needed, often underestimating the complexity of certain tasks. However, as the course progressed, I became more adept at breaking down tasks and gauging their intricacies, leading to improved accuracy in my estimates. The iterative nature of the subject allowed me to learn from my initial misjudgments and refine my estimation skills over time.

# Learning from Code Reviews

Participating in code reviews, both as a reviewer and a reviewee, has been instrumental in my growth as a developer. When my code underwent review, I gained valuable insights into different perspectives and coding styles. Constructive feedback helped me identify areas for improvement, enhancing both the quality of my code and my understanding of best practices. Simultaneously, conducting code reviews allowed me to develop a critical eye for identifying potential issues in others' code, fostering a collaborative and learning-oriented environment within the team.

# Overall Reflection on Practical Tasks

Reflecting on the practical tasks as a whole, if given the opportunity to oversee the subject, I would consider incorporating more real-world scenarios and industry-relevant challenges. While the existing tasks were beneficial for building foundational skills, introducing more complex and diverse projects could better prepare students for the challenges they may encounter in a professional setting. 

## Code Review Examples

Here are links to two pull requests where I actively participated in code reviews:
